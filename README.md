## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

```bash
# Clone the project to your machine
git clone git@github.com:iamxanderg/rest-api-sandbox.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd rest-api-sandbox

# Run the install
npm i
```

## Start The Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run devstart
```

The server will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any errors in the console.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run rest api tests
Open route.rest file in the rest-tests folder
Click on the 'send request' link for each rest call you want to test.
If using VS Code the results will be displayed in a newly opened editor window tab.
```
